# Week 1

Getting Started with Data Visualization in R > Week 1

- [Base R cheat sheet](https://iqss.github.io/dss-workshops/R/Rintro/base-r-cheat-sheet.pdf)

```{r, include = FALSE}
source("_common.R")
```

## Installing R and Getting Started

```{r include=FALSE}
# knitr::spin("week1/1w1_1.R")
# {r child = 'week1/1w1_1.R'}
```

## R basics

### Basic R
```{r, code = readLines("week1/1w1_1.R")}

```

### Functions in R

```{r, code = readLines("week1/1w1_2.R")}

```

## Dataframe
```{r, code = readLines("week1/1w1_3.R")}

```

## Basics of Importing Data into R
```{r, code = readLines("week1/1w1_4.R")}

```

## Base R Visualizations
```{r, code = readLines("week1/1w1_5.R")}

```

<!--chapter:end:02-week1.Rmd-->

# Week 2

Getting Started with Data Visualization in R > Week 2

```{r, include = FALSE}
source("_common.R")
```

## Introduction to the tidyverse

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

## Data import and structure in the tidyverse
## Filtering, selecting, recoding, renaming, and piping
## Recoding, Renaming, and Calculating Columns
## Grouping and summarizing data

```{r, code = readLines("week2/1w2_1.R")}

```


<!--chapter:end:03-week2.Rmd-->

# Week 3

Getting Started with Data Visualization in R > Week 3

```{r, include = FALSE}
source("_common.R")
```

## Creating reports with R Markdown
```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tinytex")
tinytex::install_tinytex()
```

<!-- ```{r setup, include=FALSE} -->
<!-- knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE) -->
<!-- ``` -->

### R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

### Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


## R Markdown Cheat Sheet

https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf

## R Markdown syntax and tables

```

## qplots and closing thoughts
```{r child = 'week3/1w3_2.Rmd'}
```
